# CSP
 Python implementation of the CSP algorithm

First implementation based on the dataset IV-1 (100 Hz) of the [BCI competition](http://www.bbci.de/competition/).
The dataset is not included in the repository but can be easily downloaded at this [link](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/#datasets).

## Version 1
First implementation based on the MATLAB tutorial inside the folder *Matlab Tutorial CSP*. The functions are all separated and are inside the file *CSP_support_function-py* and they are executed in a main file called *test_file.py*.

This version work with no major bug but it has some logical problem with the classifier and the features se√≤ector.

## Version 2 (Definitive version)
Improved version based on the function of version 1. Now all the function are inside a class (*CSP.py* file) so you can create a CSP object. I try to make the class as general as possible. For this reasons the class don't have any methods to read data. The class exepct you to provided the data in a 3D matrix of dimension **number of trials x channels x number of samples**.

The file inside this version are the following:
1. *CSP.py*: implementation of the CSP algorithm inside a class to provided an end-to-end solution
2. *CSP_support_function.py*: in this version is relegated to have some minor function to read the database.
3. *test_file.py*: testing of the class.

The class can classify the data with an hand-made LDA classifier (*trainLDA()* function) or can use a sklearn classifier passed to the function *trainClassifier()*. To evaluate a new trial use the *evaluate()* method.

The class also provided some methods to plot the trials, the features of the data and the PSD (Power Spectral Density) of the various trials.
