</pre><h2>3. Imagined movement<a name="2"></a></h2><p>In this tutorial we will look at imagined movement. Our movement is controlled in the motor cortex where there is an increased level of mu activity (8&#8211;12 Hz) when we perform movements. This is accompanied by a reduction of this mu activity in specific regions that deal with the limb that is currently moving. This decrease is called Event Related Desynchronization (ERD). By measuring the amount of mu activity at different locations on the motor cortex, we can determine which limb the subject is moving. Through mirror neurons, this effect also occurs when the subject is not actually moving his limbs, but merely imagining it.</p><h2>Credits<a name="3"></a></h2><p>The CSP code was originally written by Boris Reuderink of the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior. It is part of his Python EEG toolbox: https://github.com/breuderink/eegtools</p><p>Inspiration for this tutorial also came from the excellent code example given in the book chapter:</p><p>Arnaud Delorme, Christian Kothe, Andrey Vankov, Nima Bigdely-Shamlo, Robert Oostenveld, Thorsten Zander, and Scott Makeig.

%% 3. Imagined movement
% In this tutorial we will look at imagined movement. Our movement is
% controlled in the motor cortex where there is an increased level of mu
% activity (8–12 Hz) when we perform movements. This is accompanied by a
% reduction of this mu activity in specific regions that deal with the limb
% that is currently moving. This decrease is called Event Related
% Desynchronization (ERD). By measuring the amount of mu activity at
% different locations on the motor cortex, we can determine which limb the
% subject is moving. Through mirror neurons, this effect also occurs when
% the subject is not actually moving his limbs, but merely imagining it.
%% Credits
% The CSP code was originally written by Boris Reuderink of the Donders
% Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior. It is part of his Python EEG
% toolbox: https://github.com/breuderink/eegtools
%
% Inspiration for this tutorial also came from the excellent code example
% given in the book chapter:
% 
% Arnaud Delorme, Christian Kothe, Andrey Vankov, Nima Bigdely-Shamlo,
% Robert Oostenveld, Thorsten Zander, and Scott Makeig. MATLAB-Based Tools

% (eds.), 2009, 241-259, http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-84996-272-8
%% Obtaining the data
% The dataset for this tutorial is provided by the fourth BCI competition,
% which you will have to download youself. First, go to http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/#download
% and fill in your name and email address. An email will be sent to you
% automatically containing a username and password for the download area.
%
% Download Data Set 1, from Berlin, the 100Hz version in MATLAB format:
% http://bbci.de/competition/download/competition_iv/BCICIV_1_mat.zip
% and unzip it in a subdirectory called 'data_set_IV'. This subdirectory
% should be inside the directory in which you've stored the tutorial files.
%
% Also download the true labels of this dataset:
% http://bbci.de/competition/iii/results/berlin_IVa/true_labels_al.mat 
% and store them in the same 'data_set_IV' subdirectory you created
% earlier.
% 
% <http://bbci.de/competition/iv/desc_1.html Description of the data>
%%
% If you've followed the instructions above, the following code should load
% the data:
m = load('data_set_IV/100Hz/data_set_IVa_al.mat');
m2 = load('data_set_IV/true_labels_al.mat');

sample_rate = m.nfo.fs;
EEG = m.cnt';
nchannels = size(EEG, 1);
nsamples = size(EEG, 2);

channel_names = m.nfo.clab;
event_onsets = m.mrk.pos;
event_codes = m2.true_y;
cl_lab = m.mrk.className;
nclasses = length(cl_lab);
nevents = length(event_onsets);
%%
% Now we have the data in the following variables:

% Print some information
disp('Shape of EEG:'); disp(size(EEG));
disp('Sample rate:'); disp(sample_rate);
disp('Number of channels:'); disp(nchannels);
disp('Channel names:'); disp(channel_names);
disp('Number of events:'); disp(length(event_onsets));
disp('Event codes:'); disp(unique(event_codes));
disp('Class labels:'); disp(cl_lab);
disp('Number of classes:'); disp(nclasses);

% This is a large recording: 118 electrodes where used, spread across the
% entire scalp. The subject was given a cue and then imagined either right
% hand movement or the movement of his feet. As can be seen from the
% <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus Homunculus>, foot
% movement is controlled at the center of the motor cortex (which makes it
% hard to distinguish left from right foot), while hand movement is
% controlled more lateral.
% 
% The code below cuts trials for the two classes and should look familiar
% if you've completed the previous tutorials. Trials are cut in the
% interval [0.5–2.5 s] after the onset of the cue.

% Struct to store the trials in, each class gets an entry
trials = struct();

% The time window (in samples) to extract for each trial, here 0.5 REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH 2.5
% seconds
win = fix(0.5*sample_rate):fix(2.5*sample_rate)-1;

% Length of the time window
nsamples = length(win);

% Loop over the classes (right, foot)
codes = unique(event_codes);
for i = 1:length(cl_lab)
    cl = cl_lab{i};
    code = codes(i);
    
    % Extract the onsets for the class
    cl_onsets = event_onsets(event_codes == code);
    
    % Allocate memory for the trials
    trials.(cl) = zeros(nchannels, nsamples, length(cl_onsets));
    
    % Extract each trial
    for j = 1:length(cl_onsets)
        onset = cl_onsets(j);
        trials.(cl)(:,:,j) = EEG(:, win+onset);

function [trials_PSD, freqs] = calc_psd(trials)
%     Calculates for each trial the Power Spectral Density (PSD).
%     arguments:
%         trials - An array (channels x samples x trials) containing the signal.
%     returns:
%         An array (channels x PSD x trials) containing the PSD for each trial.

% A spike of mu activity can be seen on each channel for both classes. At
% the left hemisphere, the mu for the right hand movement is lower than for
% the foot movement due to the ERD. At the central electrode, the mu for
% the foot movement is reduced and at the right electrode the mu activity
% is about equal for both classes. This is in line with the theory that the
% right hand is controlled by the left hemiphere and the feet are
% controlled centrally.
%% Classifying the data
% We will use a machine learning algorithm to construct a model that can
% distinguish between the right hand and foot movement of this subject. In
% order to do this we need to:
% 
% # find a way to quantify the amount of mu activity present in a trial
% # make a model that describes expected values of mu activity for each class
% # finally test this model on some unseen data to see if it can predict the correct class label
% 
% We will follow a classic BCI design by Blankertz et al. [1] where they
% use the logarithm of the variance of the signal in a certain frequency
% band as a feature for the classifier.

% The script below designs a band pass filter using the |butter| function
% that will strip away frequencies outside the 8REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH15Hz window. The filter
% is applied to all trials:
function trials_filt = bandpass(trials, lo, hi, sample_rate)
%     Designs and applies a bandpass filter to the signal.
%     arguments:
%         trials      - An array (channels x samples x trials) containing the signal
%         lo          - Lower frequency bound (in Hz)
%         hi          - Upper frequency bound (in Hz)
%         sample_rate - Sample rate of the signal (in Hz)
%     returns:
%         An array (channels x samples x trials) containing the bandpassed
%         signal
    ntrials = size(trials, 3);
    
    % The butter() function takes the filter order: higher numbers mean a
    % sharper frequency cutoff, but the resulting signal might be shifted
    % in time, lower numbers mean a soft frequency cutoff, but the
    % resulting signal less distorted in time. It also takes the lower and
    % upper frequency bounds to pass, divided by the niquist frequency,
    % which is the sample rate divided by 2:
    [a, b] = butter(3, [lo/(sample_rate/2.0), hi/(sample_rate/2.0)]);

    % Applying the filter to each trial.
    % filtfilt operates across the first non-singleton dimension, so we
    % permute the trials array so that the samples are on the first
    % dimension
    trials = permute(trials, [2, 1, 3]);
    
    trials_filt = zeros(size(trials));
    for i = 1:ntrials
        trials_filt(:,:,i) = filtfilt(a, b, trials(:,:,i));
